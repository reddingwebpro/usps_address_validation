# usps_address_validation
This CLASS is designed to take advantage of the USPS API for looking up the corrected (normalized) address for a given physical address. There is very little examples of implementing the USPS API in PHP. 
  
# Configuration
When you instantiate the class, include the API key. See the example.php file for usage. If you don't have a valid USPS.com API, you can get one free at https://www.usps.com/business/web-tools-apis/welcome.htm
